  use the Prove-It pattern.

## Codex compatibility

The upstream command body below is preserved verbatim. Run it as a Codex skill:
- Resolve `agent-skills:<skill-name>` to the installed skill at `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Treat `/command` and `/agent-skills:command` as `$command` invocations; `$ARGUMENTS` means the user's arguments to this skill.
- Use Codex's subagent tools for Claude's Agent tool, with the matching custom agent name from `.codex/agents/`; keep the original orchestration and review gates.
- Resolve pack-root `references/`, `skills/`, and `docs/` paths under `.agents/`. Resolve persona-relative links from the original file under `.agents/agents/`.
- For project guidance, use the project's `CLAUDE.md` when present; otherwise use `AGENTS.md`, including when the command asks to add project guidance. Claude-specific persona discovery maps to Codex's project and personal custom agent directories.
- "Enter plan mode" means keep implementation read-only while producing the requested planning artifacts.

## Original command


Invoke the agent-skills:test-driven-development skill.

For new features:
1. Write tests that describe the expected behavior (they should FAIL)
2. Implement the code to make them pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

For bug fixes (Prove-It pattern):
1. Write a test that reproduces the bug (must FAIL)
2. Confirm the test fails
3. Implement the fix
4. Confirm the test passes
5. Run the full test suite for regressions

For browser-related issues, also invoke agent-skills:browser-testing-with-devtools to verify with Chrome DevTools MCP.
